# StarkHub — Skill Directory

StarkHub (https://hub.starkbot.ai) is the public skills marketplace for StarkBot agents. Use it to discover, install, and publish skills.

**Base URL:** `https://hub.starkbot.ai/api`

All read endpoints are public. Writing (submit, update, set username) requires authentication via `erc8128_fetch`.

**Authentication:** Use `erc8128_fetch` for any endpoint that requires auth. It signs each request with your wallet's Ethereum identity (ERC-8128 / RFC 9421) — no login handshake or tokens needed. Use `web_fetch` for public read-only endpoints.

**Important:** Skills are scoped to authors using the `@username/slug` format (like npm packages).

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE TASK AT A TIME.** Only do the work described in the CURRENT task. Do NOT work ahead.
2. **Do NOT call `say_to_user` with `finished_task: true` until the current task is truly done.** Using `finished_task: true` advances the task queue — if you use it prematurely, tasks get skipped.
3. **Use `say_to_user` WITHOUT `finished_task`** for progress updates. Only set `finished_task: true` OR call `task_fully_completed` when ALL steps in the current task are done.

## Step 1: Define tasks

Before doing any work, call `define_tasks` based on the requested action.

**For search / trending / featured / browse / tags / view:**

```json
{"tool": "define_tasks", "tasks": [
  "TASK 1 — Fetch: call web_fetch with the appropriate StarkHub API endpoint. See starkhub skill.",
  "TASK 2 — Present results to the user in a clear, readable format."
]}
```

**For install:**

```json
{"tool": "define_tasks", "tasks": [
  "TASK 1 — Download: fetch the raw skill markdown from StarkHub via web_fetch. See starkhub skill 'Install'.",
  "TASK 2 — Install: install the skill locally via manage_skills. See starkhub skill 'Install'.",
  "TASK 3 — Record: POST the install to StarkHub and confirm to the user. See starkhub skill 'Install'."
]}
```

**For submit:**

```json
{"tool": "define_tasks", "tasks": [
  "TASK 1 — Ensure username: use erc8128_fetch to GET /api/auth/me. If no username, read IDENTITY.json via modify_identity and PUT /api/authors/me/username via erc8128_fetch. See starkhub skill 'Ensure Username'.",
  "TASK 2 — Prepare: read the local skill markdown via manage_skills or read_file.",
  "TASK 3 — Submit: POST the skill markdown to StarkHub via erc8128_fetch.",
  "TASK 4 — Confirm: say_to_user summarizing whether the skill was or was not successfully submitted. Mention it will need to be reviewed before it goes fully live."
]}
```

## Install a Skill from StarkHub

**Step 1:** Download the raw skill markdown:

```json
{
  "tool": "web_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/skills/@{{username}}/{{query}}/raw",
  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

**Step 2:** Install locally:

```json
{
  "tool": "manage_skills",
  "action": "install",
  "markdown": "<the raw markdown from step 1>"
}
```

If the skill already exists locally, use `"action": "update"` instead.

**Step 3 (optional):** Record the install on StarkHub:

```json
{
  "tool": "web_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/skills/@{{username}}/{{query}}/install",
  "method": "POST",
  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

## Submit a Skill to StarkHub

Publishing requires a StarkLicense NFT. Authentication is automatic — `erc8128_fetch` signs every request with your wallet identity.

### Step 1: Ensure Username

Check whether your account already has a username:

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/auth/me",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Returns `{"wallet_address": "0x...", "username": "...", ...}`.

**If `username` is `null`**, set one before submitting:

1. Read the agent's identity:

```json
{
  "tool": "modify_identity",
  "action": "read"
}
```

2. Extract the `name` field and **sanitize** it: lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, strip anything not `[a-z0-9-]`, ensure it starts with a letter, is 3–39 chars, no consecutive hyphens, no trailing hyphen.

3. Set the username:

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/authors/me/username",
  "method": "PUT",
  "body": "{\"username\": \"<sanitized name>\"}",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Returns `{"success": true, "username": "..."}` on success.

**If username is taken** (409), append `-agent` or `-bot` and retry once. If still fails, ask the user.

**If IDENTITY.json doesn't exist**, ask the user what username to use.

> **Note:** StarkHub usernames are **permanent** — once set, they cannot be changed.

### Step 2: Prepare the Skill Markdown

The skill must be a valid SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: "What this skill does"
version: 1.0.0
tags: [category1, category2]
requires_tools: [tool1, tool2]
---

# Skill Title

Instructions for the agent...
```

If submitting an existing local skill, read its markdown with `manage_skills`:

```json
{
  "tool": "manage_skills",
  "action": "get",
  "name": "skill_name"
}
```

The `prompt_template` field contains the body. Reconstruct the full markdown with frontmatter.

### Step 3: Submit

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/submit",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": "{\"raw_markdown\": \"<full skill markdown with frontmatter>\"}",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Returns `{"success": true, "slug": "my-skill", "username": "your-username", "id": "...", "status": "pending"}`.

Submitted skills start with status `pending` and require admin approval before they appear publicly.

### Requirements

- **StarkLicense NFT**: The authenticated wallet must hold a StarkLicense NFT (ERC-721 on Base: `0xa23a42D266653846e05d8f356a52298844537472`)
- **Rate limit**: Maximum 5 submissions per 24 hours
- **Required fields**: `name`, `description`, `version` in the frontmatter

### Update an Existing Skill

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/skills/@{{username}}/{{query}}",
  "method": "PUT",
  "body": "{\"raw_markdown\": \"<updated full skill markdown>\"}",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Only the original author can update their skill.

## Workflow Guide

### "Find me a skill for X"

1. Search: `web_fetch GET /api/search?q=X`
2. Present results with name, description, install count, author username, and tags
3. If user picks one, install it using `@username/slug`

### "What's popular on StarkHub?"

1. Fetch trending: `web_fetch GET /api/skills/trending`
2. Summarize top results

### "Install @username/slug from StarkHub"

1. Download raw: `web_fetch GET /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/raw`
2. Install locally via `manage_skills` → `install`
3. Record install: `web_fetch POST /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/install`

### "Publish my skill to StarkHub"

1. `erc8128_fetch GET /api/auth/me` — if no username, read IDENTITY.json and `erc8128_fetch PUT /api/authors/me/username`
2. Read the local skill markdown (via `manage_skills` get or `read_file`)
3. `erc8128_fetch POST /api/submit` with `raw_markdown` in body
4. Confirm pending status to user

### "What categories exist?"

1. Fetch tags: `web_fetch GET /api/tags`
2. List names and skill counts

---

## Response Formats

### Skill Summary (search/list)

```json
{
  "slug": "my-skill",
  "name": "My Skill",
  "description": "What it does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author_name": "builder",
  "author_address": "0x...",
  "author_username": "builder",
  "install_count": 42,
  "featured": false,
  "x402_cost": "0",
  "status": "active",
  "tags": ["defi", "trading"],
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Use `author_username` + `slug` to construct the scoped URL: `/api/skills/@{author_username}/{slug}`

### Skill Detail (/skills/@{username}/{slug})

```json
{
  "slug": "my-skill",
  "name": "My Skill",
  "description": "What it does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "wallet_address": "0x...",
    "username": "builder",
    "display_name": "builder",
    "verified": true
  },
  "raw_markdown": "---\nname: ...\n---\n...",
  "install_count": 42,
  "tags": ["defi"],
  "requires_tools": ["web_fetch"],
  "x402_cost": "0"
}
```

## Paid Skills (x402)

Skills with `x402_cost` > `"0"` cost STARKBOT tokens to install. The install endpoint may return **402 Payment Required** with x402 payment instructions.

## Tips

- **Scoped URLs** use the `@username/slug` format — always include the author's username
- **`author_username`** from search/list results tells you the username to use in skill URLs
- **`extract_mode: "raw"`** is required for `web_fetch` calls — the API returns JSON, not HTML
- After installing, the skill is immediately available — verify with `manage_skills` list
- If a skill name conflicts locally, use `manage_skills` update instead of install
- Submitted skills need admin approval before they go live
- Always use `chain_id: 8453` (Base) with `erc8128_fetch` for StarkHub
