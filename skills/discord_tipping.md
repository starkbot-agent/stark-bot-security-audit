# Discord Tipping

Send tokens to Discord users by resolving their mention to a registered wallet address.

## Quick Start

When a user says "tip @someone X TOKEN", follow these 5 steps in order:

1. **Resolve the mention** -> Get wallet address
2. **Look up the token** -> Get contract address and decimals
3. **Convert amount** -> Human readable to raw units
4. **Set recipient** -> Store wallet address in register
5. **Transfer** -> Execute the ERC20 transfer via preset

**Amount shorthand:** Users can use "k" for thousands (1k = 1,000) and "m" for millions (1m = 1,000,000). For example: "tip @user 5k STARKBOT" means 5,000 tokens.

## Step 1: Resolve Discord Mention

Extract the Discord user ID from the mention and resolve it to a wallet address:

```tool:discord_resolve_user
user_mention: "1234567890"
```

**Note:** Pass the numeric user ID, not the raw mention format. Extract the numbers from mentions like `<@1234567890>`.

- If `registered: true` -> proceed with the address
- If `registered: false` -> tell user they need to register with `@starkbot register 0x...`

## Step 2: Look Up Token

```tool:token_lookup
symbol: "STARKBOT"
network: base
cache_as: token_address
```

This caches:
- `token_address` -> contract address
- `token_address_decimals` -> decimals (e.g., 18)

## Step 3: Convert Amount

```tool:to_raw_amount
amount: "1"
cache_as: "transfer_amount"
```

Reads `token_address_decimals` automatically and outputs raw amount.

## Step 4: Set Recipient Address

```json
{"tool": "register_set", "key": "recipient_address", "value": "<wallet_address from step 1>"}
```

## Step 5: Transfer

```tool:web3_preset_function_call
preset: erc20_transfer
network: base
```

The `erc20_transfer` preset reads `token_address`, `recipient_address`, and `transfer_amount` from registers automatically.

## Example: "tip @jimmy 1 STARKBOT"

1. Extract user ID from `<@987654321>` -> `987654321`

2. Resolve:
```tool:discord_resolve_user
user_mention: "987654321"
```
-> `{"public_address": "0x04abc...", "registered": true}`

3. Token lookup:
```tool:token_lookup
symbol: "STARKBOT"
network: base
cache_as: token_address
```
-> Address: `0x1234...`, Decimals: 18

4. Convert:
```tool:to_raw_amount
amount: "1"
cache_as: "transfer_amount"
```
-> `1000000000000000000`

5. Set recipient:
```json
{"tool": "register_set", "key": "recipient_address", "value": "0x04abc..."}
```

6. Transfer:
```tool:web3_preset_function_call
preset: erc20_transfer
network: base
```

7. Confirm: "Sent 1 STARKBOT to @jimmy!"

## Common Tokens (Base Network)

| Token | Address | Decimals |
|-------|---------|----------|
| USDC | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | 6 |
| WETH | `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006` | 18 |
| BNKR | `0x22aF33FE49fD1Fa80c7149773dDe5890D3c76F3b` | 18 |

For other tokens, use `token_lookup` to get the address.
