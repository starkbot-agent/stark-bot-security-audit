      instead of passing the burner_wallet_private_key and the wallet_provider    separately in dispatcher,  lets just encapsulate   the burner_wallet_private_key  AS a possible form of the wallet provider, since it kind of IS that .  Also do this in subagent manager.. 


      then find other areas like that and do the same --- combine them into wallet provider 






1. add a toggle for allowing safe mode external queries
